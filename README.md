# Purpose
* Supreme Project was developed for automating the task of counting the number of cylindrical plastic pipes at Supreme Industries.
* It thresholds & segments the pipes from the background and the hough's circle transform helps us identify the circles.
* To avoid false negatives and false positives, the gui is assisted with an option highlight the positions of the circles. This way the user can identify these false -ves and true +ves in his final tally.

A sample view of the GUI:
